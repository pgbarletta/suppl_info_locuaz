Reading file npt_d11.tpr, VERSION 2022 (single precision)
This run will default to '-update gpu' as requested by the GMX_FORCE_UPDATE_DEFAULT_GPU environment variable.
Changing nstlist from 40 to 80, rlist from 0.995 to 1.041

1 GPU selected for this run.
Mapping of GPU IDs to the 2 GPU tasks in the 1 rank on this node:
  PP:0,PME:0
PP tasks will do (non-perturbed) short-ranged and most bonded interactions on the GPU
PP task will update and constrain coordinates on the GPU
PME tasks will do all aspects on the GPU
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 8 OpenMP threads 


Overriding thread affinity set outside gmx mdrun

Applying core pinning offset 8

WARNING: Requested offset too large for available logical cpus, thread pinning disabled.

125000000 steps, 250000.0 ps (continuing from step 125000000, 250000.0 ps).

Writing final coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up npt_d11.gro to ./#npt_d11.gro.1#

NOTE: 17 % of the run time was spent in pair search,
      you might want to increase nstlist (this has no effect on accuracy)
